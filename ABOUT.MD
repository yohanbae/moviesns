What technologies I used:
Next.JS, SWR, Chakra UI, Back4App.
I used the themoviedb API for the movie data and Back4App to setup backend for user account, user posts and comments.


It was my first project using Back4App. I had a difficulty since there was not enough documents on Back4App but had a fun.
It took about 7 days and I believe I can reduce the time next time.
